# Aged Care Compliance Copilot

An AI-powered application designed to support caregivers and registered nurses (RNs) in Australian aged care facilities. It bridges the gap between casual, multilingual carer inputs and strict Australian clinical documentation standards, specifically aligning with the Serious Incident Response Scheme (SIRS) and the Strengthened Aged Care Quality Standards.

## Core Value Proposition

- **Multilingual Support for Carers**: Allows carers from diverse linguistic backgrounds to input observations casually via text or speech.
- **Automated Clinical Transformation**: Converts casual observations into professional, objective English clinical progress notes.
- **SIRS Compliance**: Analyzes incident reports against ACQSC guidelines to assess likely SIRS reportability and priority, drafting regulator notifications for authorised human review.
- **Clinical Triage**: Automatically flags potential risks (e.g., pressure injuries, critical symptoms) based on visual AI analysis of wound images.

## Features & Implementation Layers

To clarify what is fully functional, what is mock UI, and what is planned for the future, this project is structured into three distinct layers:

### 1. 【AI Fully Implemented】 (Live Gemini Endpoints)
The backend leverages `gemini-3.5-flash` to process real-time multimodal inputs:
- **Image Triage API (`/api/vision`)**: Analyzes wound/injury photos to determine type, severity, and potential risks, suggesting temporary care plans based on Australian guidelines.
- **SIRS Classification API (`/api/sirs`)**: Uses **Google Search Tool Grounding** to look up current ACQSC guidelines and reason about incident priority (Priority 1 vs 2), generating regulator-ready drafts.
- **Speech Translation API (`/api/audio-note`)**: Processes raw WebM audio recordings from carers in *any language* (Mandarin, Tagalog, etc.) and outputs a structured English clinical note.
- **Cross-Lingual Note API (`/api/care-note`)**: Transforms typed casual notes into professional clinical notes while providing a `nativeConfirmation` (a translation of the final note back into the carer's original language to ensure accuracy).

### 2. 【UI Fully Implemented】 (Frontend Components)
The React/Vite frontend provides a polished interface for:
- **Role-Based Access**: Distinct views for Caregivers vs. Registered Nurses.
- **Dashboard & Shift View**: Real-time overview of resident status, care minutes, and pending RN reviews.
- **Interactive Body Diagram**: Visually map injuries or observations.
- **Authorised Review Gate (Demo Feature)**: If a user attempts to downgrade an AI-flagged potential Priority 1 SIRS incident, the system pauses submission until an authorised reviewer documents the evidence and rationale. AI supports the decision; the registered provider retains final responsibility.

### 3. 【Phase 2 Planning】 (Future Roadmap)
- Deeper integration with legacy EHR systems (e.g., AutumnCare, LeeCare).
- Real-time biometric IoT integrations (e.g., automated fall detection alerts, vital sign monitoring).
- Extended native language training modules for staff.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React 19, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide Icons
- **Backend**: Express.js (Node.js), `@google/genai` SDK
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (for simulated real-time data syncing and note persistence)

## Resident game interaction model

All future production resident games use a two-screen model: the desktop or tablet displays the
immersive game world, while the resident's smartphone acts as a one- or two-button accessible
controller. Existing mouse-based browser games are prototypes, not final resident experiences.
See [GAME_CONTROLLER_ARCHITECTURE.md](./GAME_CONTROLLER_ARCHITECTURE.md) for the product contract,
accessibility rules, session lifecycle, and implementation boundary.

## Data Governance & Privacy
- This application processes simulated, non-identifiable patient data. 
- In a production environment, AI processing would require explicit consent frameworks compliant with the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).
- Currently, Gemini API calls do *not* use data for model training if configured via enterprise endpoints, ensuring organizational data security.

## Setup & Running

1. Install dependencies: \`npm install\`
2. Set environment variables: Add \`GEMINI_API_KEY\` to a \`.env\` file.
3. Start the application: \`npm run dev\`

(The application runs full-stack with a Vite middleware over an Express server on port 3000).
# MOMENT companion experience

The repository now includes the complete MOMENT older-adult companionship demo at:

```text
/moment/index.html
```

Run the full paired-device version locally with `npm run dev`, then open
`http://localhost:3000/moment/index.html`. The Express server provides the
`/api/session` endpoints used by QR pairing and phone motion events. Static
GitHub Pages can display the MOMENT interface, but real cross-device pairing
requires the Express deployment (or a future realtime backend such as Supabase).
